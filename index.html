      Chapter Two – How Much I Love You

      If my love for you was based on how i felt, what happens when you piss me off?
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
      If my love for you was based on how beautiful you were, <br> what happens when the beauty fades with age?
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
      My love is a choice mixed with the vibes of feelings… <br>
      Meaning, when the feelings fade, my choice to remain powers the engine. <br>
      My choice to love you regardless of who you are, <br> what you are and what you do, over powers all in all.
    </p>
    <br>

     <pre>
      I Love your mind,
      How you think,
      How you talk, so slow but with charisma…
      Your smile,
      Your body,
      How you stare,
      How you look, 
      How you smell,
      How you walk, yeah like a baby…

      You’re strong, <br> <br>
You are smart, <br> <br>
You are always 10 times better than you think you are. <br> <br>
You are deserving of love and affection. <br> <br>
You are more than good enough. <br> <br>
There is so much value in you that is looking to burst forth. <br> <br>

You are always 10 times better than you think you are. <br> <br>
The moment you think you’ve gotten to the best place you can ever be… Remember, <br> <br>
you’re still 10 times better than that. <br> <br>

Want to know my favorite tea? <br> <br>
It’s you my ShawTea. <br> <br>

You’re beautiful, <br> <br>
You’re sexy, <br> <br>
You’re hot, <br> <br>
Most times it’s not the weather that makes me sweat, it’s your heat. <br> <br>

Ever wondered why you look at the ground and find ants playing around your feet? <br> <br>
Now that’s sweetness assured. <br> <br>
